			A pyramid of base size n can be viewed as a set of
			processors connected as a 4-ary tree, where at each level in the pyramid,
			the processors at that level are connected as a 2-dimensional mesh.
			Alternately, it can be viewed as a tapering array of meshes. The root of
			a pyramid only has links to its four children. Each base processor has
			links to its four base-level mesh neighbors and an additional link to
			a parent. In general, a generic processor somewhere in the middle of a
			pyramid is connected to one parent, four children, and has four
			mesh-connected neighbors.
